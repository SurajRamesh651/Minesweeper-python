# Minesweeper Python Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic **Minesweeper** game. The game generates a grid with hidden mines, and the player must avoid triggering them by selecting cells in the grid. If a player selects a mine, the game ends. If they manage to avoid all the mines, they win!

## Features

- Customizable board size and number of mines.
- Automatically calculates the number of adjacent mines for each empty cell.
- Implements recursion to reveal all connected empty cells when a cell with no adjacent mines is selected.
- Game ends when a mine is hit or all non-mine cells are revealed.
